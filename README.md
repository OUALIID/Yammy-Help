### CONTRIBUTION
We worked on this together and oualid, it was fun to work on this website we are grateful to have gotten the chance to work on this project so that we can mark our foundation project.

### THE STORY
It all started with a great idea that we tried to bring to life. We have reached the tip of it only in this version, but we are planning to keep refining and updating it. The idea started with a recipe website that gives you personalized suggestions on the ingredients you have available. The first version uses an API to fetch recipes based on a chosen category.

We worked on this basic version in hopes of publishing another version later on where we'll reach the expected goals and maybe create something amazing.
